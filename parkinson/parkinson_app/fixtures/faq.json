            "answer":"Jitter and shimmer are the two common perturbation measures in acoustic\r\nanalysis. Jitter is a measure of frequency instability, while shimmer is a measure of amplitude instability. A normal voice has a small amount of instability during sustained vowel production. Normal instabilities are influences by tissue and muscle properties. Large variations in perturbation values signal increased instability at the source(laryngeal) level. Ratio of noise component to harmonic component yields information on\r\nthe ability of the individual to coordinate source and filter acoustics. Perturbation measures vary between children and adults, and may vary among professional voice users. ",
