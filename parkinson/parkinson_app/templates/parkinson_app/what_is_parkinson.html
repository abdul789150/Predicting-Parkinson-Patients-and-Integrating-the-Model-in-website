                Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement.
                Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a bearly noticeable tremor in
                just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or 
                slowing of movement.

                Parkinson's Disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may
                be mild and go un-noticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of your body and usually 
                remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect both sides.

                            <strong>Tremor:</strong> A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. 
                            You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor. 
                            Your hand may tremble when it's at rest.

                            <strong>Slowed movement (bradykinesia): </strong>Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, 
                            making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you 
                            walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag your feet as you try to walk.

                    In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually 
                    break down or die. Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons 
                    that produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine. 
                    When dopamine levels decrease, it causes abnormal brain activity, leading 
                    to impaired movement and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
                    The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to 
                    play a role, including:
                </span>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Genes:</strong> Researchers have identified specific genetic mutations that can cause 
                        Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many 
                        family members affected by Parkinson's disease.
                        However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's 
                        disease but with a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these 
                        genetic markers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Environmental triggers:</strong> Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may 
                        increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is relatively small.
                        Researchers have also noted that many changes occur in the brains of people 
                        with Parkinson's disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. 
                        These changes include:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>The presence of Lewy bodies:</strong> Clumps of specific substances within brain cells are 
                        microscopic markers of Parkinson's disease. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers 
                        believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Alpha-synuclein found within Lewy bodies:</strong> Although many substances are found within 
                        Lewy bodies, scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called 
                        alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein). It's found in all Lewy bodies in a clumped form that cells can't 
                        break down. This is currently an important focus among Parkinson's disease researchers.

                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Age:</strong> Young adults rarely experience Parkinson's disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or late 
                        life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Heredity:</strong> Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that you'll 
                        develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives in your 
                        family with Parkinson's disease.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Sex:</strong> Men are more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are women.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Exposure to toxins:</strong> Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your 
                        risk of Parkinson's disease.

                Parkinson's disease is often accompanied by these additional problems, which may 
                be treatable:

                    <li>
                        <strong>Thinking difficulties:</strong> You may experience cognitive problems (dementia) and thinking 
                        difficulties. These usually occur in the later stages of Parkinson's disease. Such cognitive 
                        problems aren't very responsive to medications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Depression and emotional changes:</strong> You may experience depression, sometimes in the 
                        very early stages. Receiving treatment for depression can make it easier to handle the 
                        other challenges of Parkinson's disease.
                        You may also experience other emotional changes, such as fear, anxiety or loss of 
                        motivation. Doctors may give you medications to treat these symptoms.

                    <li>
                        </strong>Swallowing problems:</strong> You may develop difficulties with swallowing as your condition 
                        progresses. Saliva may accumulate in your mouth due to slowed swallowing, leading 
                        to drooling.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Chewing and eating problems:</strong> Late-stage Parkinson's disease affects the muscles in 
                        your mouth, making chewing difficult. This can lead to choking and poor nutrition.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Sleep problems and sleep disorders:</strong> People with Parkinson's disease often have sleep 
                        problems, including waking up frequently throughout the night, waking up early or 
                        falling asleep during the day.
                        People may also experience rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which 
                        involves acting out your dreams. Medications may help your sleep problems.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Bladder problems:</strong> Parkinson's disease may cause bladder problems, including being 
                        unable to control urine or having difficulty urinating.
                        Constipation. Many people with Parkinson's disease develop constipation, mainly due 
                        to a slower digestive tract.

                Because the cause of Parkinson's is unknown, proven ways to prevent the 
                disease also remain a mystery.
                Some research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce 
                the risk of Parkinson's disease.
                Some other research has shown that people who consume caffeine — 
                which is found in coffee, tea and cola — get Parkinson's disease less 
                often than those who don't drink it. Green tea is also related to a 
                reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, it is still not 
                known whether caffeine actually protects against getting Parkinson's, 
                or is related in some other way. Currently there is not enough evidence 
                to suggest drinking caffeinated beverages to protect against Parkinson's.
